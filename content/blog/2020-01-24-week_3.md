# Week 3

## Editors

So I'm writing this from [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Historically I had been a [vim](https://www.vim.org/) user, with pretty-small-in-the-grand-scheme, but to my eyes pretty substantive vim config over at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/crockeo/dotfiles) repo. After deciding that I wanted something easier to use and configure, I hopped over to the [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) train, which I really really liked. There was a part of me, however, that wished I could do just a little bit more configuration. The paradigm in vscode is that you either configure plugins you already have, with pure JSON, or you write a plugin of your own.

Since RC is about trying new things, I thought I'd do something radically different. Instead of trying to write my own vim or vscode plugins, why not try emacs? So I did! Right now I'm still getting the hang of configuration (I pretty much only have package installs and hotkeys set up), but I'm planning on learning more about how to do custom configurations by writing an emacs plugin or two sometime in the future. If you want to check out my conf, go to my [.emacs.d](https://github.com/crockeo/.emacs.d) repo.

## Maths

I'm still working on my math journey, but I've pivoted hard into learning Lean. I think it's going to give me a good way to understand the material I'm interested in from both the Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications and the Homotopy Type Theory textbooks. It's hard to motivate the same kind of rigorous proof when I'm doing exercises for myself, and I think Lean is going to help me reinstitute that rigor.

Progress update is:

* On Chapter 13 of AATA
* On Proposition World of the Natural Number Game
* On Chapter 4 of Theorem Proving in Lean

## And More

I just signed a lease this past week! Or maybe technically the week before, but either way a very new thing. I'm going to be up in Washington Heights, right by Columbia Medical. That is all.
