# Adulting

I'm going to try to make up for the fact that I didn't really post this past
Friday. It doesn't count as a blog post if it's a bullet pointed list of all the
things I had done that week. So: here comes long form.

## Keys!

This past Friday I got keys from my leasing agent, and put some of my things in
my new apartment. I'm living by the 168th stations in a 1 bedroom (finally) by
myself. I haven't really got anything there yet, just an empty space, but I'm
really excited to start decorating it.

One of my friends works in art history in LA, and sent me a link to a
[website](https://fujiarts.com/) that aucitons off Edo-onward woodblock
prints. I'm honestly thinking of buying one... or several of them to hang up in
my apartment. The cheapeast are around $60, so I'd have to drop some money on
it. But hey! Real art costs real money.

## At Home

I'm home for the weekend! I couldn't make it to the RC space yesterday so I
could get up north back to Amherst. After leaving I've developed a craving
for... something, but I've been completely unable to track exactly what it
is. I've gone around town and looked for all of the things I used to eat
(home-made burritos, the egg sammy from Share, etc.) but nothing really hit the
spot. C'est la vie.

## Moving In

TODO: Move in. All packed up an ready to go, going down tomorrow. :)
