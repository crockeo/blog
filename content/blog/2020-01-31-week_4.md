# Week 4

I forgot to make a blog post. Oops. Summary:

* I [configured Emacs](https://github.com/crockeo/.emacs.d); if you know how to
  solve any of the things I have listed in my TODOs, feel free to reach out! I'd
  love to pair program at some point :)
* I moved (am moving?) into my own apartment.
  * Keys picked up this morning
  * Things moved in this Sunday
  * I'm at 168th now so if you're in Washington Heights come hang :)
